#### This project is done bit by bit in order of steps on [OpenCV Python Doc](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html)


- The link of the [space images](https://norma-2d.itch.io/space-backgrounds-pack)




You may need to install the _*opencv-python*_ to see this project, so simple with this command:
```
~$ pip3 install opencv-python
```
```
~$ pip3 install numpy
```





- For the File **_"opencv-06-counting_finger.py"_**, I've seen the details to make in here:
https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html
[![alt text](images/mediapipe_logo.svg)](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html)
This part you need to install 'mediapipe' to see the result, simplement with this command:
```
~$ pip3 install mediapipe
```




- For the file **_"opencv-07change_volumn_finger.py"_**, you may need to install the 'pycaw' package to see the result:
```
~$ pip3 install pycaw
```

To see more [_informations_](https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw)!
Oh, i forgot to tell you that you can only see the true result if run this programm in Windows because 'COMError import' problem.

**IMPORTANT:**
The lines in the comment line of this part are the function to adjust the sound from 'pycaw' if you run it in Windows remove the comments from those lines and start it up.






- For the file **_"opencv-08-face_detection.py"_**, download this:
```
~$ pip3 install face_recognition
```

- For the file **_"opencv-12-body_detection.py"_**, here is the link of holistic solution:
https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/mediapipe/python/solutions/holistic.py

(make sure to install this one if you haven't yet)
```
~$ pip3 install mediapipe
```




- For the file **_"opencv-14-virtual_mouse.py"_**:
```
~$ pip3 installpywin32

~$ pip3 installpywin32 --upgrade
```

P/s: I chose the path that I love to pursue in python, it makes me feel excited and enjoy while learning.
And I hope the same for you, so have a nice day.
