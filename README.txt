- This project is done bit by bit in order of steps on OpenCV Python Doc: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html -

You need to install the opencv python to see this project, so simple with this command:

~$ pip install opencv-python

~$ pip install numpy



- For the File "opencv-06-counting_finger.py", i've seen the details to make in this link:
https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html

This part you need to install 'mediapipe' to see the result, simplement with this command:

~$ pip install mediapipe



- For the file "opencv-07change_volumn_finger.py", you may need to install the 'pycaw' package to see the result:

~$ pip install pycaw

Here is the link to see more: https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw




P/s: I chose the path that I love to pursue in python, it makes me feel excited and enjoy while learning.
And I hope the same for you, so have a nice day.
