- This project is done bit by bit in order of steps on OpenCV Python Doc: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html -

You need to install the opencv python to see this project, so simple with this command:

~$ pip install opencv-python

~$ pip install numpy



- For the File "opencv-06-counting_finger.py", i've seen the details to make in this link:
https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html

This part you need to install 'mediapipe' to see the result, simplement with this command:

~$ pip install mediapipe



- For the file "opencv-07change_volumn_finger.py", you may need to install the 'pycaw' package to see the result:

~$ pip install pycaw

Here is the link to see more: https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw
Oh, i forgot to tell you that you can only see the true result if run this programm in Windows because 'COMError import' problem.

IMPORTANT:
The lines in the comment line of this part are the function to adjust the sound from 'pycaw' if you run it in Windows remove the comments from those lines and start it up.





- For the file "opencv-08-face_detection.py", download this:

~$ pip3 install face_recognition

Here is the link to see more: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition






P/s: I chose the path that I love to pursue in python, it makes me feel excited and enjoy while learning.
And I hope the same for you, so have a nice day.
